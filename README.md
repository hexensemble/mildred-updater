Key features, highlights, and things learnt:

**Swing-Based GUI:** Implements a user-friendly graphical interface using Java Swing components (JPanel, JButton, JTextArea, etc.). Customizes look and feel to match the systemâ€™s native design using UIManager. Text output logs the update process in real-time to a JTextArea, giving users feedback.

**Dynamic Update Fetching:** Downloads update metadata and files from a server using URL. Retrieves dynamic update links and file size details by parsing custom [url] and [size] tags in the server response.

**HTTP Connection Handling:** Manages connections with URLConnection, adding a User-Agent header for compatibility with modern servers. Handles potential networking errors gracefully with try-catch blocks.

**Download Mechanism:** Downloads files in chunks using buffered streams, with a progress update logged for each byte transferred. Saves the update as a compressed .zip file in a temporary directory.

**Zip File Handling:** Unzips downloaded updates using java.util.zip.ZipFile. Efficiently creates directories and writes extracted files to disk with buffered streams.

**Dynamic File Paths:** Uses System.getProperty("user.home") to ensure compatibility across Windows, macOS, and Linux. Special Handling for Linux: Includes explicit instructions for Linux users to manually relocate updated files if needed.

**File Copying:** Implements recursive directory traversal to copy all update files from the temporary directory to the game directory. Deletes old temporary files after the update is complete for cleanup.

**Buffered I/O:** Optimizes file read/write operations using buffers to reduce I/O overhead.

**Resilient Exception Management:** Catches and logs specific exceptions (IOException, MalformedURLException) to ensure that the program remains stable during network and file operations. Displays user-friendly error messages using JOptionPane.
